### CPSC 120

**Lab 1** 

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs due to the fact of it being one of my very first times coding. This is where we got introduced to using and exploring Linux and used a terminal for the first time. Forever will I remember this lab since it was the start of my college career in coding.

**Lab 4** 

    Lab 4, part 1 made us use code to help with conversions from milliliters to teaspoons, to tablespoons, to ounces, and into cups and vice versa. In my opinion, this was another favorite lab due to the fact this was one of the first examples I had experienced where coding was finally related to another topic rather than electronics/computers themselves. This gave me a better understanding of how coding can be implemented in one form or another in almost everything.

**Lab 10** 

    Lab 10, part 2 was about combining two different vectors to connect a county in California to its populations. What makes this lab a favorite is how we learned to connect two sets of items using two different vectors rather than doing them individually which consumes a lot more time and energy. I also liked this lab because it was an eye-opener to see how big the state I live in really is.
